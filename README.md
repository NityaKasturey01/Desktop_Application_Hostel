# Desktop Application for Maintaining Hostel Student Records

Maintaining records of broken amenities and malfunctioning of electrical appliances for each room becomes challenging to manage. Also, for transportation, hostel students need to provide their information in the register to avail night pass. The maintenance and transport department are not able to track the student requirements due to untimely communication. 
Objectives
-	To design an application which can reduce the manual entry of student records which becomes a longer process to accomplish.
-	To track the hostel students travelling and housekeeping challenges for providing them the required facilities. 
-	To provide an efficient and effective way for communicating the information to the concerned departments.
